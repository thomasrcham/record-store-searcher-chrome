# record-store-searcher-chrome

A silly brute-force Chrome extension for searching the online shops of many, many local record stores. When a search term is submitted, Chrome will open a new tab FOR EACH INCLUDED STORE which loads that store's search results directly.

NOTE: there are currently 116 stores in the list. 116 stores = 116 NEW TABS OPENED.
